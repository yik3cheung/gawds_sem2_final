        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            The Simplice Company reserves the right to refuse to accept any Gift Card (and to take alternative forms of payment) which it deems to have been tampered with, defaced, modified, duplicated, damaged, or which otherwise is suspected to be affected from fraud.

        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">There are no limitations on how many times a Gift Card can be used (until the balance is £0.00).

        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_title mt-3">Online Pre-Order and Pickup Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            When you place a Pickup Order through our Website, it needs to be accepted by us before it is confirmed. Your Pickup Order may be rejected at any time.  The Simplice Company may, for example, reject your Pickup Order if they are too busy or the Items you have ordered are temporarily unavailable.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            We will send you a notification if your Pickup Order has been accepted (the "Confirmation Notice"). The contract for the supply of any Item you have ordered comes into existence when we send the Confirmation Notice. You are responsible for paying for all Items ordered using your account and for complying with these Terms, even if you have ordered the Item for someone else. All Items are subject to availability.   
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            Simplice may use nuts or other allergens in the preparation of certain Items. We will be displaying dish by dish allergens information. Where that information is not available or if you have further questions, please contact us prior to ordering if you have an allergy. The Simplice Company cannot guarantee that any of the Items sold are free of allergens.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            When you place a Pickup Order which is accepted by The Simplice Company, we will tell you the time when your Items are expected to be ready for pickup (“Target Pickup Time”). The Target Pickup Time is not guaranteed by us. You will be required to collect your Items directly from Simplice at the Pickup Location(“The Simplice Company Food Truck”). You must arrive at the Food Truck to collect your Items at or just before the Target Pickup Time. We will hold your Items for you for 30 minutes after the Target Pickup Time. If you fail to collect your Items within 30 minutes after the Target Pickup Time, The Simplice Company may dispose of your Items. You will still be charged for the Item in the event you fail to pickup your Item from The Simplice Company.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            Unfortunately despite our best efforts things do not always go to plan and there may be times when your Items are not ready for pickup at the Target Pickup Time. If your order is not ready more than 15 minutes after the Target Pickup Time, we will work with you to make things right unless you have caused the delay (e.g. because you changed your Pickup Order after it was confirmed).
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            You have a legal right to receive goods which comply with their description, which are of satisfactory quality and which comply with any specific requirements you tell us about (and we agree to) before you place your Pickup Order. If you believe that the Items you have picked up do not comply with these legal rights, please let us know. We may request a photograph showing the problem if it is something that can be seen by inspecting the Items. We will provide a refund or Gift Card credit in respect of the affected part of the Item, unless we have reasonable cause to believe that the problem was caused after pickup.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="terms_body mt-3">
            Prior to processing your refund or Gift Card credit, we may take into account relevant factors including the details of the Pickup Order, your account history, what happened on or immediately after pickup and information from our staff members.
